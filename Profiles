Profiles: [ site:github.com "joined on" "public activity" -tab.activity ]
Profiles with location: [ site:github.com "san francisco" "joined on" "public activity" -tab.activity ]

You can also expand your search by removing [ -tab.activity ] in any of the strings examples above. Or target the activity page with [ tab.activity ]
Additionally, you can include “email *” in your search string to return profiles that contain an email address in them, however email addresses are obfuscated and the returned results may include some noise if the term email is used elsewhere in the users profile.
Narrow results by when a user joined: By year “joined on * 2009″  or by month  “joined on mar *”
